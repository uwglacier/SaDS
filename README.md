# SubAerial Drainage System model
The SaDS model calculates development of the supraglacial drainage system, accounting for distributed hillslope flow along with discrete channelized flow in supraglacial streams and rivers. Both the distributed and channelized flow evolve dynamically. This model is heavily influenced by the Glacier Drainage System model [GlaDS](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20146) (Werder et al., JGR 2013).

# Flow routing algorithms
This directory contains matlab code implementing a very simple flow routing algorithm that simulates moulin hydrographs for internally drained catchments. The algorithm computes flow paths and converts these to flow delay times assuming a constant velocity. This simple method is used to approximate the optimal moulin distribution.
